Director of data science for Wiley Research, helping authors, editors, and publishers make better data-driven decisions through the application of NLP, machine learning, and deep learning.

My everyday toolkit includes Python, pandas, plotly, scikit-learn, and I'm getting into PyTorch now as well.

Previously I was the Editor-in-Chief of the materials science journal _Advanced Functional Materials_, and the product manager for ChemPlanner, a retrosynthesis prediction tool for the pharmaceutical industry. My PhD is in polymer science, where I studied coupling proteins to electrically conductive polymers for sensing applications.

I emigrated from the US to Germany in 2004, where I photograph vineyards and castles in the scenic Rheingau region.
